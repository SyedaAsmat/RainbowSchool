Description
NUnit is used to do unit testing for an existing OOP backend prototype application for storing school data.


Problem Statement:
Rainbow School is developing a simple OOP based system for storing information about teachers, students, and subjects. This system is based on C#. It has developed the prototype classes in .NET and wants to put unit testing in place to test the validity of these classes.
The objective is to build a Windows Class Library project for the existing OOP classes first, and then create another project which will do unit testing for those classes.


Following are used:
Visual Studio Windows: An IDE to code the application
NUnit: To write and run tests in Microsoft .NET programming languages
Moq: Framework used in unit testing
Application Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub
GitHub: To store the code and track its versions


Following tasks are performed:
Setup NUnit and Moq to test the existing project.
Use Assertions to check valid functioning of the storage classes.
Use Moq where mocking is required.
Use Data driven tests to populate objects with test data.
Use NUnit TestRunner to run all the tests.
